1. Thousands of years ago, the Mississippi River was formed by glaciers from the last Ice Age. As the glaciers melted, the river became large and powerful as it wound its way south through Minnesota. 
(51)


2. Over time, the sandstone along the banks of the Mississippi was chomped away by the powerful river. Sandstone is just what it sounds like. It is stone made out of compressed, or hard-packed, sand. Water softened the sandstone. Natural caves were formed in the area that is now St. Paul, Minnesota. 
(51)


3. However, sandstone can wash away. It cannot maintain holes like limestone caves. Limestone has weak spots where dripping water can form holes. If there are no holes, there is not enough fresh air for people to breathe. Only some of the caves could be used because of this.
(48)


4. The caves had a long history of interesting uses once they were discovered, and sandstone was a reason for the caves’ popularity. Carving sandstone was easy because it is like packed sugar. There was no limit to the caves that could be made. People could keep digging back into the cliffs. 
(51)


5. They could make the caves they wanted. One person who made his own caves was Lyman Dayton. Even though sandstone limited the usefulness of these caves, Dayton found a way to make a business from sandstone. Lyman Dayton made his own caves in the late 1840s. 
(46)


6. The sand that crumbled from the sandstone was worth money. Dayton carved out the sandstone himself using simple tools like a shovel. Dayton sold the sand. Then the caves stood quiet. They were just empty holes. In the late 1880s, three Frenchmen arrived. 
(43)


7. They found an odd use for the caves. The caves were located along a busy road. The Frenchmen used manure dropped by animals along the road. They spread the manure inside the cave. Why? To grow mushrooms. The trio earned good money from this tasty crop! 
(46)


8. In the early 1900s, the daughter of one of the Frenchmen got married. She did not want to grow mushrooms. So the married couple opened a restaurant in one of the caves. Suddenly, “Castle Royal” was the place to go! The food there was delicious.
(45)






9. People also loved the shows where famous musicians of the time played and sang. Mostly they just loved to be seen at Castle Royal! After many years the restaurant closed. That was not the end of this cave! Two American cheese makers moved in. 
(44)


10. The cold cave was perfect for a cheese factory! Early settlers dreamed up ways to use St. Paul’s caves. Now most of St. Paul’s caves are closed, but some are open for special events and tours. Visitors can explore the caves with a guide as they learn how the caves became part of Minnesota’s history.

 11. Skyscrapers reach right into the sky. Some days, the tops of the tallest ones are hidden in clouds. The first skyscraper was built about 100 years ago. A huge fire had destroyed a lot of buildings in Chicago. People needed new ones. Architects had new things to make taller buildings possible, like steel and safety elevators. 
(55)


12. Though the Home Insurance Building was only 10 stories high, it was a start. It wasn’t long before skyscrapers were 20 or 30 or 40 stories high. Then, the Empire State Building went higher than 100 stories. But the tallest buildings of the 20th century are the Petronas Towers in Malaysia.
(51)


13. You could never build a structure of bricks or stone so tall. The weight of each floor and wall sitting on top of the others would make it collapse. A skyscraper is built in a different way. A frame is made from steel or concrete. Columns go up and down. Beams go across. 
(53)


14. The frame holds the building up, just like your skeleton holds you up.
 Engineers use wind tunnels to test models of skyscrapers. The frames have to withstand strong gusts. There’s a big part of the skyscraper you don’t see. Before the frame goes up, backhoes dig a huge hole for the foundation. 
(52)


15. It can go four or more floors deep. Sometimes steel pilings are hammered down to solid rock. They are bolted to the columns and hold the skyscraper in place like roots hold a tree.
In Texas, where the solid rock is too far down, skyscrapers are built on thick slabs of concrete.
(52)


16. In Los Angeles, engineers are putting rubber pads under the old City Hall to hold it steady and keep it from collapsing when earthquakes shake the ground. It takes a very large team of people to put a skyscraper up. Cranes are used to lift the steel beams. Ironworkers wrestle the beams in place. 
(54)






17. They tighten thousands of bolts. They weld the pieces together. When the ironworkers reach the top, they raise a fir tree or a flag into the sky, just like mountain climbers when they reach the top of a new peak. A few floors below, other workers hang wall and window sections almost like curtains. 
(54)


18. They install pipes and wires. They paint and decorate the rooms.
Finally, they reach the top floor too, and the building is done.
Skyscrapers are busy places, full of thousands and thousands of people in offices, restaurants and stores, apartments and hotel rooms. Taller skyscrapers are being designed all the time. 
(51)


19. In Japan, architects have a model for Sky City 1000. It would be 196 floors tall. Triple-decker elevators would whisk people up and down. People in some cities don’t want new skyscrapers to cast shadows on other buildings, or parks. But people still dream about skyscrapers as tall as mountains. Who knows how high they could go?
(57)

20. Lakesha was singing again. Sam could hear her through his bedroom wall, even with the door closed. Up, up, up she climbed to a very high note that she held for a long time. A brief silence followed while she caught her breath, and then she started singing all over again.
(51)


21. Lakesha had been practicing every night since she had found out she was the lead in the school musical. Sam had to admit that she was pretty good, but she was also very loud. That morning, he had asked his mom if she could hear the singing at her office across town. 
(52)


22. She had chuckled, reached into a kitchen drawer, and handed him a pair of earplugs. Sam now pulled them out of his desk drawer and stuck them in his ears like she had shown him. Lakesha was still singing, but amazingly, she sounded much farther away. Sam smiled and returned to working on his drawing.
(55)


23. Lakesha had always been the lively one in the family. She wore bright colors, laughed often, and loved to take charge. She was a natural performer, always jumping up to sing or dance when friends and family gathered. Sam loved color, too, but not in his clothing. 
(47)


24. He loved paints and pastels and colored pencils and everything else connected to drawing and painting. He did not like to be the center of attention. The world offered so much for him to see—he would much rather be sitting quietly, drawing pad in hand. 
(46)






25. Sam took a deep breath and explained that pine trees have thick trunks that get thicker at the bottom and green branches that come much farther down the trunks. Before he knew what he was doing, he had borrowed Maria’s paintbrush to show the fifth graders what he meant. 
(49)


26. He began applying the paint onto the canvas with swift, certain strokes. Then he stopped, surprised by what he was doing. He could feel the heat of embarrassment moving up his neck and covering his face. But Ms. Ramos and the students were smiling. Then they began to clap.
(49)


27. Karen had always yearned to visit a beach. However, she had imagined something quite different from what she saw now. She had imagined pure white sand and bright blue waters. Instead, she saw a narrow strip of ugly sand, and the water looked brown and dirty.
(46)
28. A shaggy green mane of seaweed wove its way along the narrow shoreline, where brown water swirled next to sand that was the color and texture of crushed peanuts. Karen sighed. Instead of the warmth of the sunshine on her skin, a dark line of clouds loomed, and a chilly wind sliced through her jacket.
(55)

29. With her eyes closed, Karen began to notice the soft swoosh of the waves, which sounded like the recording of ocean waves she played at home at bedtime. Then she heard the cry of a seagull. As Karen turned her face upward, she felt the cold wind on her face and realized that it felt rather good.
(57)

30. Crisp, clear. The salty smell of the water mixed with the earthy smell of fish and rotting plant life, she decided, would smell the same on any beach. When Karen opened her eyes again, she looked not at the unattractive, crinkly seaweed, but out to the horizon, where the gray sky met the dark water. 
(55)

31. Karen wrapped that thought around her like a warm blanket and began her search along the beach, looking for something nice to show her classmates. She knew that Mr. Patel had gone to considerable trouble to arrange this trip. Unsure of what else to do, Karen bent down to study the seaweed. 
(52)
32. Maybe she could just say that she did not know seaweed would be on the beach and leave it at that? She reached down to pick up a clump, but she noticed a small, pale object inside it, still under the water where it pooled in a shallow hole.
(49)



33. When Karen picked it up, she gasped. A tiny seahorse had its tail wrapped around one end of the seaweed. The seahorse had been floating in the water and was still alive. What a wonderful sea treasure this was! Karen shouted for Mr. Patel, who quickly placed the entire clump of seaweed into a container.
(55)
34. Enchanted, the students marveled over the discovery. Karen’s grim half-smile was gone. She smiled widely as she stared at the elegant creature swaying in the water, clinging to the ragged seaweed. The day had definitely been full of the unexpected. Maybe that was not always so bad.
(47)
35. When Mr. Patel returned the seahorse to the ocean, it scooted off into the water like a tiny submarine. A delighted laugh rolled out of Karen like the waves rolling toward shore. She was at the beach, and it was better than her dreams.
(44)
36. Imagine you work with a team of ocean scientists. You are watching an amazing video sent from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). A team member sitting beside you is operating the ROV, which is exploring the ocean floor far below your ship. Suddenly, the ROV’s headlights reveal a ridge of shellfish called mussels on the muddy ocean floor.
(57)
37. Beyond the ridge is what appears to be a lake sitting on the ocean floor. Moving the ROV closer, the operator reaches a probe out to the lake’s surface. The touch sends ripples spreading across the surface of the thick water. Your team has found a seafloor lake!
(48)
38. A seafloor lake is a pool of very salty water on the bottom of the ocean. It has a clear surface and a shoreline. You can even see a wave pass across the surface of the lake. The lakes are of different sizes. Some are as small as 3 feet across. 
(51)
39. Other lakes are much larger and can be 65 feet long! Layers of salt lie below the ocean floor. Over a long period of time, the salt dissolves. Then super-salty water leaks out of the ocean floor, but it does not mix with the water around it.
(47)


40.  Instead, the super-salty water gathers together and forms pools on the ocean floor. The water in these lakes is three to five times saltier than the ocean water around it. The salt in the lake makes it more dense, or heavier, than the ocean water around it. 
(47)


41. The bottom of the ocean is like a barren desert. Sunlight does not reach far below the surface, so it is pitch-black. Few plants are able to grow, and there is little food for animals to eat. Some seafloor lakes, though, are able to support animal and plant life.
(49)

42.The most famous seafloor lake, the Brine Pool, is in the Gulf of Mexico. It is 2,100 feet below the surface, which means divers are unable to visit the area. However, submarines have traveled to the Brine Pool to study this unique underwater habitat. What they have found is an underwater oasis.
(52)
43. Living around the Brine Pool is a large population of mussels, crabs, shrimp, and worms. Methane gas vents surround the lake and release chemicals from below the ocean floor. The creatures are able to live off these chemicals. Seafloor lakes create another world of life in an otherwise lifeless place.
(50)
44. Stephan and I said confidently at once, wanting to assure Dad that we were up to the job. Actually, the mass of food and supplies looked a little scary because we had a pretty long way to walk to the campsite. We both stood in silence, each of us hoping to come up with a plan.
(56)




45.  He grabbed both of our skateboards and set them side by side on the ground. He removed all the hot dog toppings from the box they were in and flattened the box across the skateboards. We first loaded two bags of ice onto the skateboards. Then we added the pots, which we stuffed with bags of marshmallows.
